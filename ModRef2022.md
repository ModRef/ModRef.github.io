ModRef 2022 is the 21st in a [series of workshops on Constraint Modelling and Reformulation](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~frisch/ModRef/) organized as part of FLoC 2022, the [Federated Logic Conference](https://www.floc2022.org/).
It will be held on July 31st, preceding CP 2022, the [28th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming](http://cp2022.a4cp.org/).

Recent years have witnessed significant research devoted to modelling and solving problems with constraints. The importance of modelling and model reformulation is widely recognized. There have been developments in systematic and automated ways of improving aspects of modelling and model reformulation. Tools and techniques which provide the ability to target multiple kinds of solvers were also developed.

The key goals of this workshop are to extend the understanding of constraint modelling and to automate aspects of modelling or model reformulation to extend the reach of constraint solvers on difficult problems and ease the task of modelling. We solicit original papers that contribute to either or both of these goals. Workshop topics include:

- Application papers describing interesting problems and interesting ways to model them;
- Contributions to understanding modelling that could guide the manual or automatic formulation of models;
- Identification of the criteria that should be used in evaluating models and the design of pragmatic techniques that facilitate the choice and possible combination among alternative models;
- Design of higher-level modelling languages;
- Automatic reformulation techniques; and
- Techniques which allow automatically targeting multiple kinds of solvers from a single declarative model.

This year ModRef will again paper submissions. In addition to the presentation of research results, we especially welcome submissions of novel (ongoing) work, recent breakthroughs, future directions, and descriptions of interesting aspects of existing systems.

There are two types of paper submissions: extended abstracts (at most two pages) and full papers (at most fifteen pages). References are not part of the page limit. Papers are submitted through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=modref2022), as a PDF file following [LIPIcs guidelines](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author).

We also accept (and encourage) non-traditional electronic submissions, such as interactive works/tool demonstrations. In this case, please contact the [chairs](mailto://modref@a4cp.org) to discuss the suitability of your submission for ModRef.

All submissions will be reviewed and those that are well-written and make a worthwhile contribution to the topic of the workshop will be accepted for publication in the workshop proceedings. The proceedings will be available electronically at CP 2022. Accepted contributions will be allowed a time slot for a presentation at the workshop. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend and present at the workshop. Please note that every workshop participant needs to be registered for the workshop.
