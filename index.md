ModRef 2019 is the 18th in a [series of workshops on Constraint Modelling and Reformulation](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~frisch/ModRef/).
ModRef has always been co-located with the [Constraint Programming (CP) conference](http://www.a4cp.org/events/cp-conference-series) in the past.
The workshop will run at [The 25th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming, CP2019](http://cp2019.a4cp.org/) in Stamford, CT, U.S. on September 29th 2019.

Recent years have witnessed significant research devoted to modelling and solving problems with constraints.
The importance of modelling and model reformulation is widely recognised.
There have been developments in systematic and automated ways of improving aspects of modelling and model reformulation.
Tools and techniques which provide the ability to target multiple kinds of solvers were also developed.

The key goals of this workshop are
to extend the understanding of constraint modelling and
to automate aspects of modelling or model reformulation to extend the reach of constraint solvers on difficult problems and ease the task of modelling.
We solicit original papers that contribute to either or both of these goals.

Workshop topics include:

- Application papers describing interesting problems and interesting ways to model them;
- Contributions to understanding modelling that could guide the manual or automatic formulation of models;
- Identification of the criteria that should be used in evaluating models and the design of pragmatic techniques that facilitate the choice and possible combination among alternative models;
- Design of higher-level modelling languages;
- Automatic reformulation techniques;
- Techniques which allow automatically targeting multiple kinds of solvers from a single declarative model.


## <a name="callForPres"></a> Call for Presentations/Papers

The call for presentations will appear here shortly.

<!---
This year ModRef will again include (abstract-only) presentations that are not based on submitted papers.

In addition to the presentation of research results, we especially welcome talks describing ongoing work,
recent breakthroughs, future directions, and descriptions of interesting aspects of existing systems.
It will be a lightweight submission: we only ask for a title and a 1-page abstract to be used in the program.

Submissions must be in PDF format, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style.
Please submit your title and abstract using [EasyChair](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=modref2018).
Submissions will be reviewed promptly for appropriateness.

## <a name="callForPapers"></a> Call for Papers (Deadline passed)

In addition to the short form abstract only submissions we are also accepting full paper submissions.
These must be formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style and must be within 15 pages excluding references.
Submissions of shorter papers, including position papers, are also welcome.
<!---Please submit your paper in PDF format using [EasyChair](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=modref2018).
All submissions will be reviewed and those that are well-written and make a worthwhile contribution to the topic
of the workshop will be accepted for publication in the workshop proceedings.
The proceedings will be available electronically at CP 2018.
At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop.
Please note that every workshop participant needs to be registered for the workshop.
