ModRef 2018 will be the 17th in a [series of workshops on Constraint Modelling and Reformulation](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~frisch/ModRef/).
ModRef has always been co-located with the [Constraint Programming (CP) conference](http://www.a4cp.org/events/cp-conference-series) in the past.
This year ModRef will run at [The 24th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming](http://cp2018.a4cp.org/) in Lille, France on the 27th of August.

Recent years have witnessed significant research devoted to modelling and solving problems with constraints.
The importance of modelling and model reformulation is widely recognised.
There have been developments in systematic and automated ways of improving aspects of modelling and model reformulation.
Tools and techniques which provide the ability to target multiple kinds of solvers were also developed.

The key goals of this workshop are
to extend the understanding of constraint modelling and
to automate aspects of modelling or model reformulation to extend the reach of constraint solvers on difficult problems and ease the task of modelling.
We solicit original papers that contribute to either or both of these goals.

Workshop topics include:

- Application papers describing interesting problems and interesting ways to model them;
- Contributions to understanding modelling that could guide the manual or automatic formulation of models;
- Identification of the criteria that should be used in evaluating models and the design of pragmatic techniques that facilitate the choice and possible combination among alternative models;
- Design of higher-level modelling languages;
- Automatic reformulation techniques;
- Techniques which allow automatically targeting multiple kinds of solvers from a single declarative model.


## <a name="callForPres"></a> Call for Presentations (Deadline: June 29th, 2018)

This year ModRef will again include presentations that are not based on submitted papers.

In addition to the presentation of research results, we especially welcome talks describing ongoing work,
recent breakthroughs, future directions, and descriptions of interesting aspects of existing systems.
It will be a lightweight submission: we only ask for a title and a 1-page abstract to be used in the program.

Submissions must be in PDF format, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style.
The link for the submission website will appear here soon.

Please submit your title and abstract in PDF format using [EasyChair](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=modref2018).
Submissions will be reviewed promptly for appropriateness.

## <a name="callForPapers"></a> Call for Papers (Deadline: June 29th, 2018)

In addition to the short form abstract only submissions we will continue to accept full paper submissions.
These must be formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style and must be within 15 pages excluding references.
Submissions of shorter papers, including position papers, are also welcome.
Please submit your paper in PDF format using [EasyChair](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=modref2018).

All submissions will be reviewed and those that are well-written and make a worthwhile contribution to the topic
of the workshop will be accepted for publication in the workshop proceedings.
The proceedings will be available electronically at CP 2018.
At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop.
Please note that every workshop participant needs to be registered for the workshop.
