ModRef 2021 is the 20th in a [series of workshops on Constraint Modelling and Reformulation](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~frisch/ModRef/).
ModRef has always been co-located with the [Constraint Programming (CP) conference](http://www.a4cp.org/events/cp-conference-series) in the past.
The workshop will run at [The 27th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming, CP2021](http://cp2021.a4cp.org/), held virtually on October 25th 2021.

Recent years have witnessed significant research devoted to modelling and solving problems with constraints.
The importance of modelling and model reformulation is widely recognised.
There have been developments in systematic and automated ways of improving aspects of modelling and model reformulation.
Tools and techniques which provide the ability to target multiple kinds of solvers were also developed.

The key goals of this workshop are
to extend the understanding of constraint modelling and
to automate aspects of modelling or model reformulation to extend the reach of constraint solvers on difficult problems and ease the task of modelling.
We solicit original papers that contribute to either or both of these goals.

Workshop topics include:

- Application papers describing interesting problems and interesting ways to model them;
- Contributions to understanding modelling that could guide the manual or automatic formulation of models;
- Identification of the criteria that should be used in evaluating models and the design of pragmatic techniques that facilitate the choice and possible combination among alternative models;
- Design of higher-level modelling languages;
- Automatic reformulation techniques;
- Techniques which allow automatically targeting multiple kinds of solvers from a single declarative model.


## <a name="callForPres"></a> Call for Presentations
This year ModRef will again include presentations that are not based on submitted papers. In addition to the presentation of research results, we especially welcome talks describing ongoing work, recent breakthroughs, future directions, and descriptions of interesting aspects of existing systems. Lightweight submissions must be in the form of a one (1) or two (2) pages extended abstract (excluding references) in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style.
Please submit your extended abstract in PDF format using [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=modref2021).

We also accept (and encourage) non-traditional electronic submissions, such as interactive works/tool demonstrations. In this case, please contact the chairs to discuss the suitability
of your submission for ModRef.

## <a name="callForPapers"></a> Call for Papers 
In addition to the short form abstract only submissions we are also accepting full paper submissions. These must be formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style and must be within 15 pages excluding references. Submissions of shorter papers, including position papers, are also welcome.
Please submit your paper in PDF format using [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=modref2021).

All submissions will be reviewed and those that are well-written and make a worthwhile contribution to the topic of the workshop will be accepted for publication in the workshop proceedings. The proceedings will be available electronically at CP 2021. Accepted contributions will be allowed a time slot for a presentation at the workshop. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend and present at the workshop. Please note that every workshop participant needs to be registered for the workshop.

Please feel free to get in touch (modref2021@tudelft.nl) to express interest, to have an informal discussion, etc.

## <a name="callForLightning"></a> Call for Lightning Talks
This year, ModRef will host a round-table discussion to identify exciting directions for future
improvements in modelling, and model transformation. As a lead-in to this, we will be holding
a series of 2-3 minute lightning talks, with the theme `What really bugs me about modelling is...`.

Do you have some favourite problem, that is just really awkward to model? Or a really nice formulation,
that somehow becomes garbage by the time it reaches a solver? Some way you really want to use
solvers, and they just won't let you? Come along, and vent your spleen! And together, maybe we'll come
up with some neat ideas.
