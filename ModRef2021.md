ModRef 2021 is the 20th in a [series of workshops on Constraint Modelling and Reformulation](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~frisch/ModRef/).
It takes place virtually on October 25, preceding CP 2021, the [The 27th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming, CP2021](http://cp2021.a4cp.org/).

The main aim of the workshop is to identify recent trends in constraint modelling, including (but not limited to) innovative modelling techniques, reformulation and preprocessing techniques, and understanding search. This year we have two important components:

1. (half a day) Short presentations and talks about recent developments by the participants.

    Topics of interest include:
    - Application papers describing interesting problems and interesting ways to model them;
    Contributions to understanding modelling that could guide the manual or automatic
    formulation of models;
    - Identification of the criteria that should be used in evaluating models and the design of
    pragmatic techniques that facilitate the choice and possible combination among
    alternative models;
    - Design of higher-level modelling languages;
    - Automatic reformulation techniques;
    - Techniques which allow automatically targeting multiple kinds of solvers from a single declarative model.

2.  (half a day) The second half will be a collaborative exercise to identify challenges for the next five years of modelling, with the goal of producing a jointly-written white/research paper to guide future research. This component will consist of a series of lightning talks (from both users and developers of modelling tools) pointing out pain-points or desired features for modelling, then a series of focussed discussions to identify common features, possible solutions and research directions.

## <a name="invtalks"></a> Invited Talks

### **Prof. Torsten Schaub** (Universität Potsdam, Germany) - Answer Set Programming

### **Dr. Bart Bogaerts** (Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium) - Predicate Logic as a Modelling Language: The IDP system


## <a name="callForPapers"></a> Call for Papers 
We invite submissions of novel (ongoing) work, recent breakthroughs, future directions, and descriptions of interesting aspects of existing systems related (but not limited) to the following topics:

Application papers describing interesting problems and innovative ways to model them;
Contributions to understanding modelling that could guide the manual or automatic formulation of models;
Identification of the criteria that should be used in evaluating models and the design of pragmatic techniques that facilitate the choice and possible combination among alternative models;
Design of higher-level modelling languages;
Automatic reformulation techniques;
Techniques which allow automatically targeting multiple kinds of solvers from a single declarative model.

There are two types of submissions: extended abstracts (at most two pages) and full papers (at most fifteen pages). References are not part of the page limit. Papers are submitted through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=modref2021) in the [Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19238648/data/v1).

We also accept (and encourage) non-traditional electronic submissions, such as interactive works/tool demonstrations. In this case, please contact the [chairs](mailto://modref2021@tudelft.nl) to discuss the suitability of your submission for ModRef.

All submissions will be reviewed and those that are well-written and make a worthwhile contribution to the topic of the workshop will be accepted for publication in the workshop proceedings. The proceedings will be available electronically at CP 2021. Accepted contributions will be allowed a time slot for a presentation at the workshop. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend and present at the workshop. Please note that every workshop participant needs to be registered for the workshop.


## <a name="callForLightning"></a> Call for Lightning Talks
This year, ModRef will host a round-table discussion to identify exciting directions for future
improvements in modelling, and model transformation. As a lead-in to this, we will be holding
a series of 2-3 minute lightning talks, with the theme `What really bugs me about modelling is...`.

Do you have some favourite problem, that is just really awkward to model? Or a really nice formulation,
that somehow becomes garbage by the time it reaches a solver? Some way you really want to use
solvers, and they just won't let you? Come along, and vent your spleen! And together, maybe we'll come
up with some neat ideas.

Please submit your lightning talk ideas through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=modref2021) by submitting a PDF with a few sentences
describing the main idea of your talk.
